# Component_Testing
Sample code for each individual component.

This repository should contain ONLY code used to demonstrate each component. For example, for a motor:
Filename: Motor_Model#
Code in this file should be minimized to only connect to the motor and spin it forward, backward, varying speed. Nothing else.
